SpaceShooter02 - Dev Notes
----------------------------

Unreal Engine 5 project based on:
https://github.com/RSkala/SpaceShooter01
* Twin Stick shooter built in Unity C#

----------------------------
Source Assets:

Space Shooter Asset Pack by Gustavo Vituri
https://gvituri.itch.io/space-shooter

Location in Project:
* Assets-Source/SpaceShooterAssets

----------------------------
TODO:
* Before importing sprite assets:
  * Determine appropriate PPU
    * Note: Base sprite sizes should be 8x8, according to source asset link
  * Set Project Settings according to 2D "standards" (e.g. disable Bloom)
  * Add PostProcessVolume to default game map and set various 2D settings.
    * Note: It is understood that, even without a "PostProcessVolume", Unreal still applies default post process settings that MUST be manually disabled in a level PostProcessVolume
  * Define extended Paper2D project settings to apply to all textures
  * Determine gameplay axis/plane (most likely XZ plane for this game, as I plan on NOT using Character or Navmesh features).

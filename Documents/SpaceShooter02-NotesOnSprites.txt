Paper Flipbook Issue:
* While I was setting up the "Dash Ready" flipbook, the sprites were not appearing at all in the flipbook.
* PFB_Dash_Ready.uasset

Solution:
* When using a Paper Flipbook, if the sprite has any translucency, the material needs to be set for the key frame:

It defaults to:
* MaskedUnlitSpriteMaterial

But it needs to be set to:
* TranslucentUnlitSpriteMaterial

This is set for the entire Flipbook in Details under:
* Default Material

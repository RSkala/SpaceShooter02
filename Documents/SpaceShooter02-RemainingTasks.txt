Remaining Tasks

SHOULD FIX:
* Adjust spawning "circle" center so it is in front of the player slightly
  * This will address the issue which the enemies mostly spawn "next to" or "behind" the player
* Get voice sounds for "OPTIONS", "STATS", and "ACHIEVEMENTS"
* Add "CONFIRM?" Screen for Clearing Scores and Clearing Stats
* Adjust / Fix alignment of "background" sprites.
  * Fix / close visible gaps in the background sprites
* Add new enemy types.
* Add harder enemy types depending on difficulty
* Figure out why sometimes enemies dont spawn at a spawn animation location
* Implement a spawn limiter (make sure no more than X enemies are on screen at once)
* Change "pitch" on pickup item sound (Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do)

NICE TO HAVE:
* Implement Achievements
* Implement Achievement Screen and Achievements Button in Options Screen
* Add "Longest Play Session" Stat
* Implement ITargetable interface (instead of casting to get PlayerShipPawn)

PACKAGED GAME:
* Ensure VO is enabled when packaging game
* Implement forcing of aspect ratio
* Implement screen resolutions (or force windowed fullscreen)
* Adjust collision Trace to be a little further out. In packaged games, the player and pickup penetrate slightly deeper than in editor.

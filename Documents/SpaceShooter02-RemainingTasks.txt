Remaining Tasks

SHOULD FIX:
* Get voice sounds for "OPTIONS", "STATS", and "ACHIEVEMENTS"
* Add harder enemy types depending on difficulty
* Figure out why sometimes enemies dont spawn at a spawn animation location
* Implement a spawn limiter (make sure no more than X enemies are on screen at once)
* Change "pitch" on pickup item sound (Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do)

NICE TO HAVE:
* Implement Achievements
* Implement Achievement Screen and Achievements Button in Options Screen
* Add "CONFIRM?" Screen for Clearing Scores and Clearing Stats
  * Alternative:  "Sounds" Screen, "Data" Screen

PACKAGED GAME:
* Reminder: Ensure VO is enabled when packaging game
* Implement forcing of aspect ratio
* Implement screen resolutions (or force windowed fullscreen)

-------
Issue:
-------
* Some save game data seems corrupted on first load
  * "Time spent looking at stats" repeated where it should have the ship selections
    * This is likely due to the data not being cleared
    * The saved data SHOULD have been created when the game first launched.
* Update: This was likely due to FHighScoreData not getting initialized properly as Unreal expects.
  * This is possibly fixed.

Remaining Task

MUST FIX:
* Fix issue where pickups are still attracted to player after player defeat.
* Ensure VO is enabled when packaging game
* Different sound for "add time" on item pickup

SHOULD FIX:
* Set player "helper" sprites to current player ship sprite
* Adjust spawning "circle" center so it is in front of the player slightly
  * This will address the issue which the enemies mostly spawn "next to" or "behind" the player
* Get voice sounds for "OPTIONS", "STATS", and "ACHIEVEMENTS"
* Add "CONFIRM?" Screen for Clearing Scores and Clearing Stats
* Adjust / Fix alignment of "background" sprites.
  * Fix / close visible gaps in the background sprites
* Add new enemy types.
* Add harder enemy types depending on difficulty
* Allow for even lower "time between spawns" so the game gets even harder
* Any trigger input should "Boost" player
* Implement forcing of aspect ratio
* Implement screen resolutions (or force windowed fullscreen)

NICE TO HAVE:
* Implement Achievements
* Implement Achievement Screen and Achievements Button in Options Screen
* Add "Longest Play Session" Stat

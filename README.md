# GENERIC SPACE SHOOTER
 2D Twin Stick Shooter built harnessing the power of **Unreal Engine 5**!!!

 2D Game Development is not very well documented, so I decided to challenge myself to make a 2D game... also I love 2D games!

 As I develop this game, I will update this document with various notes:

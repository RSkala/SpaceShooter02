 2D Twin Stick Shooter built in **Unreal Engine 5**

 Lately, I've been doing a bit of research with 2D development with Unreal Engine, so I decided to rebuild this project in UE5 that I previously built in Unity: <br>

 2D Game Development is not very well documented, so I decided to challenge myself to make a 2D game... also I love 2D games!

 As I develop this game, I will update this document with various notes:

 Once core gameplay and a game loop is implemented, I hope to implement the following features:
 * Local Co-op
 * Gameplay Ability System
 * Network Replication
 * Blockchain (maybe!)
 * ???
